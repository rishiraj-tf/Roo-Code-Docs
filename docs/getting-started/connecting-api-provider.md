# Connecting Your First AI Provider

Roo Code requires an API key from an AI model provider to function. We recommend these options for accessing the powerful **Claude 3.7 Sonnet** model:

- **OpenRouter (Recommended):** Provides access to multiple AI models through a single API key. Ideal for getting started quickly with minimal setup. [View pricing](https://openrouter.ai/models?order=pricing-low-to-high).
- **Anthropic:** Direct access to Claude models. Requires API access approval and may have [rate limits depending on your tier](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/rate-limits#requirements-to-advance-tier). See [Anthropic's pricing page](https://www.anthropic.com/pricing#anthropic-api) for details.

## Getting Your API Key

### Option 1: LLM Routers

LLM routers let you access multiple AI models with one API key, simplifying cost management and switching between models. They often offer [competitive pricing](https://openrouter.ai/models?order=pricing-low-to-high) compared to direct providers.

#### OpenRouter

1. Go to [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/)
2. Sign in with your Google or GitHub account
3. Navigate to the [API keys page](https://openrouter.ai/keys) and create a new key
4. Copy your API key - you'll need this for Roo Code setup

#### Requesty

1. Go to [requesty.ai](https://requesty.ai/)
2. Sign in with your Google account or email
3. Navigate to the [API management page](https://app.requesty.ai/api-keys) and create a new key
4. **Important:** Copy your API key immediately as it won't be displayed again

## Configuring Roo Code in VS Code

Once you have your API key:

1. Open the Roo Code sidebar by clicking the Roo Code icon (<KangarooIcon />) in the VS Code Activity Bar
2. In the welcome screen, select your API provider from the dropdown
3. Paste your API key into the appropriate field
4. Select your model:
   - For **OpenRouter**: select `anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet` ([model details](https://openrouter.ai/anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet))
   - For **Anthropic**: select `claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219` ([model details](https://www.anthropic.com/pricing#anthropic-api))

:::info Model Selection Advice
We strongly recommend **Claude 3.7 Sonnet** for the best experience—it generally "just works" out of the box. Roo Code has been extensively optimized for this model's capabilities and instruction-following behavior.

Selecting alternative models is an advanced feature that introduces complexity. Different models vary significantly in how they follow tool instructions, parse formats, and maintain context through multi-step operations. If you do experiment with other models, choose ones specifically designed for structured reasoning and tool use.
