# Roo Code 3.25.9 Release Notes (2025-08-07)

This release adds new AI models to the Fireworks provider, fixes token calculation issues, and improves the chat creation experience.

## Provider Updates

* **Fireworks AI Models**: Added GLM-4.5 series models (355B and 106B parameters with 128K context) and OpenAI gpt-oss models (20b for edge deployments, 120b for production use) to expand model selection options (thanks alexfarlander!) ([#6784](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/6784))

## QOL Improvements

* **Chat Input Focus**: The chat input now automatically focuses when creating a new chat via the + button, allowing you to start typing immediately ([#6689](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/6689))

## Bug Fixes

* **Token Calculation**: Fixed rounding errors that prevented certain models like GLM-4.5 from working properly by ensuring max output tokens are correctly rounded up (thanks markp018!) ([#6808](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/6808))

## Misc Improvements

* **Cloud Integration**: Reverted to using the npm package version of @roo-code/cloud for improved build stability and maintenance ([#6795](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/6795))
