# Roo Code 3.25.1 Release Notes (2025-07-29)

This release adds a powerful new AI model to the Chutes AI provider and improves command execution reliability.

## Provider Updates

* **Chutes AI - GLM-4.5-Air Model**: Added support for the GLM-4.5-Air model to the Chutes AI provider with 151K token context window for complex reasoning tasks and large codebase analysis - completely free to use (thanks matbgn!) ([#6377](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/6377))

## QOL Improvements

* **Subshell Validation**: Improved handling and validation of complex shell commands with subshells, preventing potential errors when using command substitution patterns ([#6379](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/6379))
