# Roo Code 3.25.2 Release Notes (2025-07-29)

This release fixes the diff view display when background edits are disabled, adds organization-level MCP controls, and improves UI interactions.

## QOL Improvements

* **Slash Command Icon Hover State**: Fixed the hover state for the slash command icon to provide better visual feedback during interactions ([#6388](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/6388))

## Bug Fixes

* **Diff View Display**: Fixed an issue where the diff view wasn't showing before approval when background edits were disabled ([#6386](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/6386))

## Misc Improvements

* **Organization MCP Controls**: Added support for managing MCP servers at the organization level, allowing centralized configuration across teams ([#6378](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/6378))
