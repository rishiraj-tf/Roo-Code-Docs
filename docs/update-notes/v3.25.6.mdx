# Roo Code 3.25.6 Release Notes (2025-08-02)

This release features support for the new Horizon Beta stealth model, cloud provider profile synchronization, and bug fixes.

## Horizon Beta Stealth Model via OpenRouter

We've optimized support for OpenRouter's new stealth model Horizon Beta ([#6577](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/6577)):

- **Improved Performance**: Set max tokens to 32k (reduced from 128k default)
- **Free to Use**: Thanks to OpenRouter, Horizon Beta is an improved version of Horizon Alpha and remains free

A big thanks to OpenRouter for providing this innovative stealth model to the community!

## Bug Fixes

* **Claude Code Error Handling**: Fixed "spawn claude ENOENT" error when using Claude Code provider, now provides better error handling and installation guidance (thanks JamieJ1!) ([#6565](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/6565))

## Misc Improvements

* **Cloud Provider Profile Sync**: Added support for syncing provider profiles from the cloud, enabling automatic synchronization across devices and team collaboration ([#6540](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/6540))
* **Type Definitions**: Updated @roo-code/types to v1.41.0 for latest type compatibility ([#6568](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/6568))
