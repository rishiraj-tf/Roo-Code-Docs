This release includes bug fixes and improvements related to file writes, UI themes, custom instructions, and checkpoints.

## Bug Fixes & Improvements

*   Fixed a bug where aborting during file writes would not revert the changes.
*   Ensured dialog backgrounds honor the VS Code theme.
*   Made it possible to clear default custom instructions for built-in modes.
*   Added a help button linking to the documentation site.
*   Switched checkpoints logic to use a shadow git repository to avoid issues with hot reloads and polluting existing repositories. (thanks Cline!)
