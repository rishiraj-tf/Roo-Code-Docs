# Roo Code 3.25.4 Release Notes (2025-07-31)

This release introduces two new AI providers, enhances prompt suggestions with conversation context, and improves various tool functionalities.

## Doubao Provider Support

We've added support for Doubao, ByteDance's AI model provider (thanks AntiMoron!) ([#6345](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/6345)):

- **Access to ByteDance AI Models**: Connect to Doubao's language models for your AI-powered development tasks
- **Full Integration**: Complete provider implementation with API handling and embedding support
- **Easy Configuration**: Simple setup through Roo Code's provider settings with internationalized prompts

Doubao expands your AI model options, giving you access to ByteDance's competitive language models alongside existing providers.

> **📚 Documentation**: See [Doubao Provider Guide](/providers/doubao) for setup instructions and available models.

## SambaNova Provider Integration

We've integrated SambaNova as a new LLM provider (thanks snova-jorgep!) ([#6188](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/6188)):

- **High-Speed Inference**: Experience competitive inference speeds for faster AI responses
- **Broader Model Selection**: Access SambaNova's diverse range of language models
- **Seamless Integration**: Configure and use SambaNova models just like any other provider

SambaNova brings enterprise-grade AI infrastructure to Roo Code, offering powerful alternatives for your development workflows.

> **📚 Documentation**: See [SambaNova Provider Guide](/providers/sambanova) for configuration details.

## Context-Aware Prompt Enhancement

Prompt enhancement now uses your conversation history for better suggestions (thanks liwilliam2021!) ([#6343](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/6343)):

- **Smarter Suggestions**: Enhancement considers your last 10 messages to generate more relevant prompts
- **Reduced Hallucinations**: Context awareness prevents the AI from making unfounded suggestions
- **Flexible Configuration**: Use a separate API configuration for enhancement operations
- **Toggle Control**: Enable or disable task history inclusion based on your needs

To enable this feature: Settings → Prompts tab → Select "ENHANCE" → Check "Include task history in enhancement" for better context.

> **📚 Documentation**: See [Prompt Enhancement Guide](/features/enhance-prompt) for configuration options.
