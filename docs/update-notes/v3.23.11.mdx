# Roo Code 3.23.11 Release Notes (2025-01-13)

This release adds new provider options and improves mode navigation.

## Provider Updates

* **Groq Kimi K2**: Added Kimi K2 model option for Groq users with improved token handling reliability for models with equal max tokens and context window

## QOL Improvements

* **Mode Navigation**: Added bidirectional mode cycling with Cmd+Shift+. keyboard shortcut to switch to previous mode, making mode navigation more efficient when you overshoot your target mode (thanks mkdir700!) ([#5695](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5695))

## Misc Improvements

* **GitHub Actions**: Fixed GitHub Actions workflow warnings by removing invalid parameters from CI/CD configuration (thanks hamirmahal!) ([#5676](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5676))
