# Roo Code 3.23.2 Release Notes (2025-01-13)

This release fixes auto-approval workflow issues.

## Bug Fixes

* **Auto-Approval**: Fixed issue where subsequent tools required manual approval after using `update_todo_list`, even when auto-approval was enabled (thanks daniel-lxs!) ([#5508](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5508))
