# Roo Code 3.16.2 Release Notes (2025-05-07)

This release includes clearer XML tool use formatting instructions for easier understanding and improved error handling for a more robust experience.

---

## Tool Use Improvements
*   **Clarified XML Tool Formatting Instructions**: Documentation and prompts now provide clearer examples of how to format XML tool use, preventing the `<tool_name>` and other tool use errors. 
*   This fix is largely targeted at issues faced with Gemini 2.5 when using tools

---

## Misc Improvements
*   **Improved Error Handling for Streaming**: Fixed an issue where the app could get stuck waiting for a response. The app now recovers gracefully from errors during streaming, reducing the likelihood of unresponsive behavior and improving reliability. (thanks monkeyDluffy6017!)
