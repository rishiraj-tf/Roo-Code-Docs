# Roo Code 3.25.7 Release Notes (2025-08-05)

This release introduces Groq's GPT-OSS models, adds support for Claude Opus 4.1, brings two new AI providers (Z AI and Fireworks AI), and includes numerous quality of life improvements.

## Groq GPT-OSS Models

Groq now offers OpenAI's GPT-OSS models with impressive capabilities ([#6732](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/6732)):

- **GPT-OSS-120b and GPT-OSS-20b**: Mixture of Experts models with 131K context windows
- **High Performance**: Optimized for fast inference on Groq's infrastructure

These models bring powerful open-source alternatives to Groq's already impressive lineup.

## Z AI Provider

Z AI (formerly Zhipu AI) is now available as a provider (thanks jues!) ([#6657](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/6657)):

## Claude Opus 4.1 Support

We've added support for the new Claude Opus 4.1 model across multiple providers ([#6728](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/6728)):

- **Available Providers**: Anthropic, Claude Code, Bedrock, Vertex AI, and LiteLLM

Note: OpenRouter support for Claude Opus 4.1 is not yet available.
