# Roo Code 3.25.13 Release Notes (2025-08-13)

This release adds Sonnet 1M context support for AWS Bedrock, improves internationalization, and fixes search functionality.

## Features

* **Sonnet 1M Context Support**: Enable 1M token context window for Claude 3.5 Sonnet when using AWS Bedrock, allowing you to process much larger documents and have longer conversations ([#7032](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7032))

## QOL Improvements

* **Internationalization**: The Account button now displays in your selected language instead of always showing in English (thanks zhangtony239!) ([#6978](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/6978))
* **Agent File Flexibility**: Roo Code now recognizes both AGENT.md and AGENTS.md files for agent rules, with AGENTS.md checked first for compatibility (thanks Brendan-Z!) ([#6913](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/6913))

## Bug Fixes

* **Search Tool Reliability**: Fixed the search_files tool failing when encountering permission-denied files - it now continues working and returns results from accessible files (thanks R-omk!) ([#6757](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/6757))

## Provider Updates

* **OpenAI**: Removed the deprecated GPT-4.5 Preview model from available options as it was removed from the OpenAI API (thanks PeterDaveHello!) ([#6948](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/6948))
