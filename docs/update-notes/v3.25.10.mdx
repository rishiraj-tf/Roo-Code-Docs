# Roo Code 3.25.10 Release Notes (2025-08-07)

This release introduces support for OpenAI's GPT-5 models with verbosity controls and fixes important bugs in XML parsing and error message display.

## GPT-5 Model Support

We've added support for OpenAI's latest GPT-5 model family ([#6819](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/6819)):

- **GPT-5 Models**: Three new model variants are now available:
  - `gpt-5-2025-08-07`: The full GPT-5 model, now set as the default for OpenAI Native provider
  - `gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07`: A smaller, faster variant for quick responses
  - `gpt-5-nano-2025-08-07`: The most compact version for resource-constrained scenarios

- **Verbosity Controls**: New settings to control model output detail levels (low, medium, high), allowing you to fine-tune response length and detail based on your needs

- **Experimental Model**: Also includes the experimental `nectarine-alpha` model for testing cutting-edge capabilities

All GPT-5 models support streaming responses for real-time interaction.

> **📚 Documentation**: See [OpenAI Provider Guide](/providers/openai) for detailed information about GPT-5 models and verbosity settings.

## Bug Fixes

* **XML Parsing**: Fixed errors when using the apply_diff tool with complex XML files containing special characters by implementing proper CDATA sections ([#6811](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/6811))
* **MCP Error Messages**: Fixed an issue where MCP server errors displayed raw translation keys instead of proper error messages ([#6821](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/6821))
