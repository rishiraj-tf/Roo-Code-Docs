# Additional Features

This page describes additional features in Roo Code that enhance your development workflow.

---

## Suggested Responses

Roo Code provides suggested responses to questions, saving you time typing. These suggestions appear as buttons below the chat input box after you ask a question. Click a suggestion to quickly use it as your next prompt.

This feature aims to streamline your workflow by anticipating your potential follow-up questions and providing one-click access to relevant prompts.

## Text to Speech

Roo Code includes a Text-to-Speech (TTS) feature that reads out the AI responses, allowing you to listen to the information instead of reading it. This can be helpful for accessibility, learning, or simply for a change of pace.

To use Text-to-Speech, simply enable it in the Roo Code settings. Once enabled, a speaker icon will appear next to each AI response in the chat. Click the icon to start listening.
