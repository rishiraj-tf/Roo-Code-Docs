## Overview

Slash commands let you create reusable prompts and workflows that can be triggered instantly. Turn complex multi-step processes into single commands, standardize team practices, and automate repetitive tasks with simple markdown files.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Workflow Automation**: Turn complex multi-step processes into single commands
- **Team Standardization**: Share commands across your team for consistent practices
- **Context Preservation**: Include project-specific context in every command
- **Quick Access**: Fuzzy search and autocomplete for instant command discovery

---

## Creating Custom Commands

Custom commands extend Roo Code's functionality by adding markdown files to specific directories:

- **Project-specific**: `.roo/commands/` in your workspace root
- **Global**: `~/.roo/commands/` in your home directory

The filename becomes the command name. For example:
- `review.md` → `/review`
- `test-api.md` → `/test-api`
- `deploy-check.md` → `/deploy-check`

:::info Command Name Processing
When creating commands through the UI, command names are automatically processed:
- Converted to lowercase
- Spaces replaced with dashes
- Special characters removed
- Leading/trailing dashes removed

Example: "My Cool Command!" becomes `my-cool-command`
:::

**Basic Command Format**

Create a simple command by adding a markdown file:

```markdown
# review.md
Please review this code for:
- Performance issues
- Security vulnerabilities
- Code style violations
- Potential bugs
```

**Advanced Command with Frontmatter**

Add metadata using frontmatter for enhanced functionality:

```yaml
---
description: Comprehensive code review focusing on security and performance
argument-hint: <file or directory to review>
---

# Security-First Code Review

Please perform a thorough security review of the selected code:

1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Check for proper access controls
   - Verify token validation
   - Review permission checks

2. **Input Validation**
   - Identify potential injection points
   - Check for proper sanitization
   - Review data type validation

3. **Security Best Practices**
   - Look for hardcoded secrets
   - Check for secure communication
   - Review error handling for information leakage
```

**Frontmatter Fields:**
- **`description`**: Appears in the command menu to help users understand the command's purpose
- **`argument-hint`**: (Optional) Provides a hint about expected arguments when using the command. See [Argument Hints](#argument-hints) for detailed information

---

## Command Management UI

Roo Code provides a dedicated UI for managing custom commands.

<img src="/img/slash-commands/slash-commands-4.png" alt="Accessing the command manager from Roo Code panel" width="600" />

*Click the commands icon in the Roo Code panel to open the command manager*

**Creating a New Command:**

1. Type your command name in the input field (e.g., "Sample command name")
2. Click the `+` button to create the command

<img src="/img/slash-commands/slash-commands-1.png" alt="Custom Commands Management Interface" width="400" />


3. A new file will be created and opened automatically (e.g., `sample-command-name.md`)

<img src="/img/slash-commands/slash-commands-2.png" alt="Creating a new command by typing name and clicking plus button" width="600" />


---

## Using Slash Commands

Type `/` in the chat to see a unified menu containing both types of commands. The menu shows both custom workflow commands and mode-switching commands in the same interface.

<img src="/img/slash-commands/slash-commands-3.png" alt="Newly created command file opened in editor" width="600" />


1. **Unified Menu**: Both custom commands and mode-switching commands appear together
2. **Autocomplete**: Start typing to filter commands (e.g., `/sam` shows `sample-command-name`)
3. **Fuzzy Search**: Find commands even with partial matches
4. **Description Preview**: See command descriptions in the menu
5. **Visual Indicators**: Mode commands are distinguished from custom commands with special icons

---

## Argument Hints

Argument hints provide instant help for slash commands, showing you what kind of information to provide when a command expects additional input.

When you type `/` to bring up the command menu, commands that expect arguments will display a light gray hint next to them. This hint tells you what kind of argument the command is expecting.

For example:
- `/mode <mode_slug>` - The hint `<mode_slug>` indicates you should provide a mode name like `code` or `debug`
- `/api-endpoint <endpoint-name> <http-method>` - Shows you need both an endpoint name and HTTP method

After selecting the command, it will be inserted into the chat input followed by a space. The hint is not inserted; it is only a visual guide to help you know what to type next. You must then manually type the argument after the command.

**Adding Argument Hints to Custom Commands**

You can add argument hints to your custom commands using the `argument-hint` field in the frontmatter:

```yaml
---
description: Generate a new REST API endpoint with best practices
argument-hint: <endpoint-name> <http-method>
---
```

This will display as `/api-endpoint <endpoint-name> <http-method>` in the command menu.

**Best Practices for Argument Hints:**
- **Be Specific**: Use descriptive placeholders like `<file-path>` instead of generic ones like `<arg>`
- **Show Multiple Arguments**: If your command needs multiple inputs, show them all: `<source> <destination>`
- **Use Consistent Format**: Always wrap placeholders in angle brackets: `<placeholder>`
- **Keep It Concise**: Hints should be brief and clear

**Common Questions:**

- **"What if I don't provide the argument?"** The command might not work as expected, or it might prompt you for more information. The hint is there to help you get it right the first time.
- **"Do all commands have hints?"** No, only commands that are designed to take arguments will have hints. Commands that work without additional input won't show hints.
- **"Can I use a command without replacing the hint?"** The hint text (like `<mode_slug>`) needs to be replaced with actual values. Leaving the hint text will likely cause the command to fail or behave unexpectedly.

## Best Practices

**Command Naming:**
- Use descriptive, action-oriented names
- Keep names concise but clear
- Use hyphens for multi-word commands
- Avoid generic names like `help` or `test`
- Note: Names are automatically slugified (lowercase, special characters removed)
- The `.md` extension is automatically added/removed as needed

**Command Content:**
- Start with a clear directive
- Use structured formats (lists, sections)
- Include specific requirements
- Reference project conventions
- Keep commands focused on a single task

**Organization:**
- Group related commands in subdirectories
- Use consistent naming patterns
- Document complex commands
- Version control your commands
- Share team commands in the project repository

---

## Troubleshooting

**Commands Not Appearing:**
- **Check file location**: Ensure custom command files are in `.roo/commands/` or `~/.roo/commands/`
- **Verify file extension**: Custom commands must be `.md` files

**Command Not Found:**
When a slash command isn't found, the LLM will see:
```
Command 'command-name' not found. Available commands can be found in .roo/commands/ or ~/.roo/commands/
```

**Command Conflicts:**
- Custom project commands override global custom commands with the same name
- Use unique names to avoid conflicts
- When creating duplicate names through the UI, numbers are appended (e.g., `new-command-1`, `new-command-2`)

:::info About Mode Commands
The slash menu includes mode-switching commands (like `/code`, `/ask`) that fundamentally change the AI's operational mode - they don't just inject text but switch the entire AI context. Custom modes you create also appear as slash commands (e.g., a mode with slug `reviewer` becomes `/reviewer`). These mode commands cannot be overridden by custom workflow commands. Learn more in [Using Modes](/basic-usage/using-modes) and [Custom Modes](/features/custom-modes).
