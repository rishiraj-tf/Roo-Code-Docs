## Integration Guide

### Step 1: Get TrueFoundry Gateway Configuration

1. **Navigate to AI Gateway Playground**: Go to your TrueFoundry AI Gateway playground
2. **Access Unified Code Snippet**: Use the unified code snippet feature
3. **Copy Configuration Details**: Note down:
   - Base URL (e.g., `https://your-control-plane.truefoundry.cloud/api/llm`)
   - Model name (use exactly as shown in the snippet)
   - Your authentication token

### Step 2: Configure Roo Code

1. **Open Roo Code Settings**: 
   - Click the Roo Code icon (ðŸ¦˜) in VS Code's Activity Bar
   - Navigate to settings or configuration

2. **Add Custom Provider**:
   - Select "Custom" or "OpenAI Compatible" from the provider dropdown
   - Configure the following settings:

   ```json
   {
     "baseUrl": "https://your-control-plane.truefoundry.cloud/api/llm",
     "apiKey": "your-truefoundry-token",
     "model": "openai-main/gpt-4o"
   }
   ```

## Recommended Models

Choose models based on your specific use cases:

### **Code Generation & Complex Tasks**
- **`openai/gpt-4o`**: Best for complex code generation and reasoning tasks
- **`anthropic/claude-4-sonnet`**: Excellent for code understanding and following instructions


:::tip Model Names
Always use the exact model name as shown in your TrueFoundry Gateway unified code snippet to ensure proper routing.
